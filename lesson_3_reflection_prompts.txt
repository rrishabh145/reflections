When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If there are multiple people working on the same project, then I would want all of them to have access to the files.
For that purpose, I would create a remote repository rather than a local one so all of them can easily contribute to 
the project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I might be working on a different version of the same files which i dont wish to upload or change on the remoter repository. If git
automatically stays up to date with my remote repository, then there can be instances where my working data might be lost or some unwanted 
changes might take place in my local repository which i may not want.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks basically copies someone else's repository on github to your own repository on github itself with a link to the original repository to
whom it belonged. Cloning on the other hand copies the whole repository from github to your local computer or from one place to another 
place within a computer without a clear reference as to from whom has it been copied. Branches on the other hand emerge from the master node.
It can be made to do some different changes than the ongoing work in the master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It will help in keeping a track of the last update that was made on github. It will be helpfull as we can know what changes we did in our 
local repository compared to the last updates online repository. It can also help if there are changes made on both the local repository and 
the online repository over a period of time and we try to merge the two either online on github or locally.
