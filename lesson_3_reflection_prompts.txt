When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If there are multiple people working on the same project, then I would want all of them to have access to the files.
For that purpose, I would create a remote repository rather than a local one so all of them can easily contribute to 
the project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I might be working on a different version of the same files which i dont wish to upload or change on the remoter repository. If git
automatically stays up to date with my remote repository, then there can be instances where my working data might be lost or some unwanted 
changes might take place in my local repository which i may not want.
